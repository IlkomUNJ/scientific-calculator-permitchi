## How to use 
For basic operations, use as normal. Input number then operation then second number and so on. Click "=" for results. (works for +, -, %, /, *, !) 

For complex operations, input number first then desired format.
for example: input 90, then click on sin() button, will automatically format as sin(90). Click "=" for results. (works for sin, cos, tan and inverted forms)
